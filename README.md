# Digit Recognizer 🧠🔢

This project implements a basic neural network from scratch in Python using only NumPy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

It was built to understand the fundamental math behind neural nets — including forward propagation, backpropagation, and basic weight updates — without using high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Loads and processes the MNIST digit dataset
- Builds a simple neural network architecture (1 or 2 hidden layers)
- Uses sigmoid or ReLU activation
- Trains the network using backpropagation and updates weights via gradient descent
- Evaluates accuracy on test data

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib (optional for visualizing digits or loss)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo  
2. Install requirements:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the Python script to train and test the network

- How neural networks actually work under the hood  
- How to implement backpropagation step-by-step  
- How activation functions, weights, and gradients interact  
- Importance of vectorization for performance
